## 2 ‚ñ∏ Phase 1: Configurable MVP & Developer Experience (Target: v0.2.x) üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

*Duration: Estimated 2-4 weeks. Focus: Core usability and robustness.*
**Sprint Goal:** Enable user configuration, ensure file integrity, improve performance for common cases, and establish basic CI/CD and documentation infrastructure.

| ID | Task | Sub-Tasks & Details | Acceptance Criteria (AC) |
|----|------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| **P1-S1: Configuration System** | `[tool.path-comment]` in `pyproject.toml` | 1. Design schema: `exclude_globs` (list of str), `custom_comment_map` (dict str:str), `default_mode` (enum: "file", "folder", "smart"). <br> 2. Implement config loading (e.g., using `tomllib` for Py3.11+, `toml` for older). <br> 3. Integrate config values into core logic (detectors, injectors). <br> 4. Graceful handling of missing/malformed config (use defaults, issue warnings). | ‚Ä¢ Config values correctly override defaults. <br> ‚Ä¢ Unit tests for each config option and its interaction. <br> ‚Ä¢ `path-comment --show-config` CLI option to display active configuration. |
| **P1-S2: File Integrity** | CRLF, Encoding, Atomicity | 1. **Line Endings:** Detect (LF vs CRLF) and preserve original line endings. <br> 2. **Encoding:** Default to UTF-8. Implement fallback detection using `chardet` for reading. Always write UTF-8 unless explicitly configured otherwise (future). <br> 3. **Atomic Writes:** Implement write operations by writing to a temporary file then renaming to prevent data loss on interruption. | ‚Ä¢ Files with CRLF endings remain CRLF after modification. <br> ‚Ä¢ Files with non-UTF-8 (but `chardet`-detectable) encodings are processed correctly. <br> ‚Ä¢ Interruption during file write doesn't corrupt original file. <br> ‚Ä¢ Unit tests for various encodings and line endings. |
| **P1-S3: Initial Performance Boost** | Multiprocessing | 1. Identify suitable parallelizable tasks (file discovery, individual file processing). <br> 2. Implement `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` for I/O-bound file operations. <br> 3. Benchmark: Measure time taken on a sample repo (e.g., 1k, 5k, 10k files) before and after. <br> 4. Add CLI option to control number of workers (e.g., `--workers N`, default to `os.cpu_count()`). | ‚Ä¢ Demonstrable speed-up (e.g., ‚â•1.5x) on repos with >1000 files on multi-core systems. <br> ‚Ä¢ No race conditions or deadlocks introduced. <br> ‚Ä¢ Graceful degradation if multiprocessing is not available/beneficial. |
| **P1-S4: Test Coverage Enhancement** | Increase Coverage | 1. Integrate `pytest-cov` into test suite. <br> 2. Configure CI to report coverage (e.g., Codecov/Coveralls or GHA summary). <br> 3. Set CI build to fail if coverage drops below 90%. <br> 4. Analyze coverage reports and write tests for uncovered branches/lines in existing code. | ‚Ä¢ Test coverage consistently ‚â• 90%. <br> ‚Ä¢ CI fails on coverage drop. |
| **P1-S5: Basic Documentation Site** | `mkdocs-material` | 1. Initialize `mkdocs` with `mkdocs-material` theme in `docs/`. <br> 2. Create initial pages: Home (README content), Quick Start (installation, basic usage), Configuration (how to use `pyproject.toml` options). <br> 3. Setup GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy docs to GitHub Pages on `develop` branch pushes. | ‚Ä¢ Docs site successfully builds and deploys. <br> ‚Ä¢ Core information is accessible and clearly presented. |
| **P1-S6: CI/CD Matrix** | Cross-Platform, Multi-Python | 1. Configure GitHub Actions workflow. <br> 2. Test on Python versions: 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12. <br> 3. Test on OS: Ubuntu (latest), macOS (latest), Windows (latest). <br> 4. Ensure all linters, type checkers, and tests pass on all matrix combinations. | ‚Ä¢ CI pipeline runs for all specified Python versions and OS. <br> ‚Ä¢ All checks pass across the entire matrix. |
| **P1-S7: README Polish & Badges** | Enhance Readability | 1. Add badges: PyPI version (placeholder initially), CI status (GitHub Actions), test coverage, license, Python versions. <br> 2. Add a concise "Why Path-Comment-Hook?" section. <br> 3. Add a "Quick Demo" GIF/asciinema. | ‚Ä¢ README is informative and visually appealing. <br> ‚Ä¢ All badges are present and functional (or placeholders). |
| **P1-S8: Changelog Management** | Track Changes | 1. Implement a changelog tool (e.g., `towncrier`, `reno`) or establish a manual `CHANGELOG.md` update process. <br> 2. Ensure all significant changes are documented for v0.2.0 release. | ‚Ä¢ Changelog process is defined. <br> ‚Ä¢ Initial changelog entries for v0.2.x features are present. |

**Definition of Done for Phase 1 (v0.2.x):**
*   All P1 tasks completed and ACs met.
*   v0.2.0 (or subsequent v0.2.x patch) tagged and released (can be a GitHub release without PyPI for now).
*   Internal review of functionality and code quality.

## 3 ‚ñ∏ Phase 2: Hardening & Polish (Target: v0.3.x ‚Äì v0.4.x) üõ°Ô∏è

*Duration: Estimated 3-4 weeks. Focus: Robustness, performance under stress, and extensibility foundation.*
**Sprint Goal:** Ensure the tool is highly reliable through rigorous testing, performs well on large and complex projects, is secure, and has a basic plugin system for future comment types.

| ID | Task | Sub-Tasks & Details | Acceptance Criteria (AC) |
|----|------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| **P2-S1: Advanced Testing - Fuzzing** | Hypothesis | 1. Identify core functions susceptible to varied inputs (e.g., path string parsing, file content manipulation, comment generation). <br> 2. Write Hypothesis strategies for generating diverse inputs (random text, mixed encodings, complex/malformed shebangs, unusual file names/paths). <br> 3. Integrate Hypothesis tests into the `pytest` suite. | ‚Ä¢ At least 3-5 critical functions are covered by Hypothesis tests. <br> ‚Ä¢ No new bugs discovered by fuzzing in these functions. <br> ‚Ä¢ Fuzz tests run as part of CI. |
| **P2-S2: Edge Case Handling - Windows** | OS-Specific Paths | 1. Thoroughly test path normalization and manipulation with Windows-specifics: backslashes (`\`), drive letters (`C:\`), UNC paths (`\\server\share`), case-insensitivity considerations. <br> 2. Investigate and test behavior with symlinks on Windows (and other OS). Define desired behavior (resolve, ignore, treat as file). <br> 3. Ensure correct relative path generation on Windows. | ‚Ä¢ All path-related unit tests pass on Windows CI. <br> ‚Ä¢ Manual E2E tests on Windows confirm correct behavior for common and edge-case path structures. |
| **P2-S3: Performance Benchmarking & Optimization** | Scalability | 1. Develop a standardized benchmarking script/suite (e.g., using `pytest-benchmark` or custom scripts). <br> 2. Test against large synthetic monorepos (e.g., 10k, 50k, 100k files of varying sizes). <br> 3. Profile CPU and memory usage under load (e.g., using `cProfile`, `memory_profiler`). <br> 4. Identify and optimize bottlenecks if performance targets are not met (e.g., further refine multiprocessing, optimize file I/O, caching strategies for excludes). <br> 5. Publish benchmark results and methodology in docs. | ‚Ä¢ Tool processes 10k files in under a defined threshold (e.g., 30 seconds on reference hardware). <br> ‚Ä¢ Memory usage remains reasonable for large repositories. <br> ‚Ä¢ Performance results are documented. |
| **P2-S4: Security Auditing** | Code & Dependencies | 1. Integrate static analysis security tools (SAST) like Bandit into CI. <br> 2. Enable CodeQL analysis on GitHub Actions. <br> 3. Run dependency vulnerability checks (e.g., `pip-audit`, `safety`) in CI. <br> 4. Manually review any reported medium/high severity issues and remediate. <br> 5. Document security practices (e.g., in `SECURITY.md`). | ‚Ä¢ Zero high-severity issues reported by Bandit and CodeQL. <br> ‚Ä¢ No known critical vulnerabilities in dependencies. <br> ‚Ä¢ Security scan results are clean in CI. |
| **P2-S5: Basic Plugin Architecture** | Extensible Commenters | 1. Design plugin interface: How plugins register new file types and their comment syntax (e.g., using `importlib.metadata.entry_points` for a `path_comment.commenters` group). <br> 2. Refactor core logic to discover and use registered commenter plugins. <br> 3. Implement a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) plugin for a common file type not covered by default (e.g., `.vue`, `.svelte`, `.tf`). <br> 4. Add unit tests for plugin discovery, loading, and execution. | ‚Ä¢ Plugins can be discovered and used by the core tool. <br> ‚Ä¢ PoC plugin correctly adds headers to its target file type. <br> ‚Ä¢ Documentation on how to write a basic commenter plugin. |
| **P2-S6: Test Coverage > 95%** | Comprehensive Testing | 1. Review coverage reports post P1-S4. <br> 2. Target remaining untested code, especially error handling paths, complex conditional logic, and newly added features (plugins, Windows specifics). <br> 3. Update CI to fail if coverage drops below 95%. | ‚Ä¢ Test coverage consistently ‚â• 95%. <br> ‚Ä¢ CI enforces the 95% threshold. |

**Definition of Done for Phase 2 (v0.3.x - v0.4.x):**
*   All P2 tasks completed and ACs met.
*   v0.3.0 (and potentially v0.4.0) tagged and released (GitHub release).

| **GitHub App** | 1. Research GitHub App creation, permissions (code read/write, checks). <br> 2. Setup basic webhook listener for PR events. <br> 3. PoC: App posts a comment on PR if path-comments are missing. | Org-level enforcement; PR status check shows missing headers & auto-fix option. |
| **Language Server (LSP)** | 1. Research Python LSP libraries (e.g., `pygls`). <br> 2. Define LSP capabilities (diagnostics for missing headers, code actions to insert). <br> 3. PoC: Minimal LSP server providing diagnostics for a single file. | Real-time diagnostics in any editor. |
| **IDE Plugins (Advanced)** | 1. **VS Code:** Expand stub to use LSP or directly integrate core logic for real-time feedback, context menu actions. <br> 2. **JetBrains:** Research IntelliJ Platform SDK, Gradle setup. PoC for basic header insertion. | Richer experience in VS Code marketplace, JetBrains Marketplace. |
| **Pre-built Binaries** | 1. Investigate PyOxidizer, Nuitka, or PyInstaller. <br> 2. Benchmark startup time and execution speed of compiled binary vs. script. <br> 3. Setup GHA to build binaries for releases. | `pipx install path-comment-hook` bundles binary for speed & no Python env needed for end-users. |
| **Monorepo Smart Paths** | 1. Research detection of `WORKSPACE` (Bazel), `BUCK` files, `lerna.json`/`pnpm-workspace.yaml` etc. <br> 2. Define logic to determine monorepo root and calculate workspace-relative paths. <br> 3. Add config option to enable this mode. | Detect Bazel/Buck/Nx/etc. roots, insert workspace-relative header. |
| **Template Presets** | 1. Define a structure for template presets (e.g., JSON/YAML files defining comment styles, path formats). <br> 2. Implement `path-comment init --template <name>` to apply a preset. <br> 3. Add initial presets (e.g., `ros`, `default`, `academic-paper`). | `path-comment init --template ros` for niche ecosystems. |

## 7 ‚ñ∏ Governance & Quality Gates

*(This section is well-defined. Minor additions for clarity.)*

| Aspect | Policy | Tooling / Enforcement |
|--------|--------|-----------------------|
| **Semantic Versioning** | MAJOR ‚áí breaking, MINOR ‚áí new features, PATCH ‚áí bug-fix. Follow [SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org/). | Manual adherence during version bumps and release process. Changelog reflects impact. |
| **Branch Model** | `develop` (default, active dev), `main` (protected, stable releases), `feature/*`, `fix/*`, `docs/*`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*`. | GitHub branch protection rules for `main` and `develop`. |
| **CI Gates** | Ruff (lint+format), mypy (strict), pytest + coverage (‚â•90% initially, ‚â•95% for v1.0+), Bandit, CodeQL, Dependency Check. | GitHub Actions workflows. `pre-commit` hooks for local checks. |
| **Review Rules** | Minimum 1 approving review from a maintainer/designated reviewer + all CI checks green required to merge to `develop` and `main`. | GitHub branch protection rules. |
| **Deprecation** | Mark APIs `@deprecated` (or similar warning mechanism) at least 1 MINOR version before removal. Announce in changelog. | Code warnings, documentation. |
| **Issue Management** | Triage new issues with labels (bug, feature, docs, good first issue, etc.). Use milestones for sprint/release planning. | GitHub Issues, Labels, Milestones. |

---

## 8 ‚ñ∏ Risk Management

*(Expanded with more potential risks and refined mitigations.)*

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Contingency Plan |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|--------------------|
| **Comment Collision** (Header conflicts with existing user code/comments) | Medium | Medium | 1. Detect existing, similar headers and skip/warn. <br> 2. Configurable unique start/end sentinel for generated headers (e.g., `<!-- PCH: path/to/file -->`). <br> 3. Option to only insert if no comment block exists at top of file. | Provide clear documentation on how to manually resolve or configure around collisions. Offer a "force" option with strong warnings. |
| **Performance Degradation** (On very large repos or with complex configurations) | Medium | High | 1. Lazy file scanning where possible. <br> 2. Efficient globbing and exclusion patterns. <br> 3. Ongoing benchmarking (P2-S3). <br> 4. Configurable file-type allow-list/deny-list. <br> 5. Optimized multiprocessing/async operations. | Offer modes for shallower scans or specific directory targeting. Profile and release performance patches. |
| **PyPI Supply-Chain Risk** | Low | High | 1. Enable 2FA on PyPI account. <br> 2. Use signed tags for releases (`git tag -s`). <br> 3. Implement PyPI `trusted-publishing` via OIDC with GitHub Actions. <br> 4. Regularly audit dependencies. | If compromised, revoke tokens, notify PyPI, release a patched version, and communicate transparently. |
| **AI Integration Costs / Reliability** | Medium | Medium | 1. Default to user-supplied API keys for cloud LLMs. <br> 2. Implement support for local LLMs via Ollama/LM Studio as a free/private alternative. <br> 3. Clear disclaimers about AI suggestion quality and potential costs. | Fallback to non-AI functionality if AI service is down or key is invalid. Provide good non-AI alternatives. |
| **Cross-Platform Inconsistencies** (Bugs specific to OS, Python version, or file systems) | Medium | Medium | 1. Comprehensive CI matrix (P1-S6). <br> 2. Specific testing for Windows path edge-cases (P2-S2). <br> 3. Encourage diverse beta testers. <br> 4. Normalize paths internally as much as possible. | Prioritize fixing platform-specific bugs quickly. Document known issues and workarounds. |
| **Low Adoption / Community Engagement** | Medium | High | 1. High-quality documentation and examples (Phase 3). <br> 2. Solve a genuine pain point effectively. <br> 3. Active engagement on relevant platforms (Phase 3 & 4). <br> 4. Make contribution easy and welcoming. | Re-evaluate unique selling proposition. Seek more user feedback. Iterate on features based on demand. |
| **Maintainer Burnout** | Medium | High | 1. Realistic scope and timelines. <br> 2. Encourage community contributions and delegate where possible. <br> 3. Automate repetitive tasks (CI/CD, releases). <br> 4. Clearly define project scope to avoid feature creep. | Onboard co-maintainers. Take breaks. Archive project if unsustainable after efforts. |
