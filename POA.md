## Path-Comment-Hook â€“ Lean & Focused Project Plan

> **Goal:** Deliver a simple, reliable Python package + pre-commit hook
> that adds relative-path headers to source files. Validate its utility with real users.

---

### **Project Vision & Principles (Simplified):**

*   **Utility First:** Solve one small problem well.
*   **Reliability:** Make it work correctly and consistently.
*   **Ease of Use:** Simple to install, configure, and run.
*   **Performance:** Fast enough not to be annoying.

---

## 0 â–¸ Executive Summary

`path-comment-hook` is a Python tool designed to automatically add or update a comment at the top of source files, indicating the file's relative path within the project. This can aid in navigation and context, especially in large codebases or when viewing files outside an IDE.

The tool has evolved significantly with comprehensive functionality including file processing, deletion of headers, intelligent ignore patterns, and user-friendly command-line interface. The immediate goal is to create a stable, well-tested `v0.1.0` release that is easily installable via PyPI.

Future development beyond `v0.1.0` will be strictly driven by user feedback and validated needs. If this core tool proves useful to a tangible number of users/projects, we will then consider adding more advanced configuration or features based on direct requests.

## 0.1 â–¸ Current Reality

*   **Active Users:** 0 (outside of developer)
*   **GitHub Stars:** 0 (or current number if any)
*   **Test Coverage:** ~69% (monitored via Codecov integration)
*   **Test Suite:** 152 passing tests across all functionality
*   **CI/CD Status:** Fully operational with cross-platform testing
*   **Market Validation:** None to date
*   **Competition:** Editor snippets, manual commenting, potentially other small scripts.
*   **Primary Value Proposition Focus (for v0.1.0):** **Reliability & Ease of Use** â€“ a comprehensive tool that *just works* for both adding and managing path comments across projects.

---

## 0.2 â–¸ Hard Questions

1.  **Why would someone use this over editor snippets or existing IDE features?**
    *   *Hypothesis:* For automated, consistent enforcement across a whole project/team, especially via pre-commit hooks, which snippets don't offer. The delete functionality also provides cleanup capabilities that snippets lack.
2.  **What's the actual, specific pain point this solves?**
    *   *Hypothesis:* Quickly understanding a file's location and context when viewed in isolation (e.g., in code reviews, terminal output, or simple editors) without relying on IDE-specific navigation. Reduces cognitive load for frequently context-switching developers. Also provides project hygiene by cleaning up headers when needed.
3.  **Have we talked to at least 10 developers (outside the project) who genuinely express a need for this specific solution?**
    *   *Action:* This needs to be done post-v0.1.0 release.
4.  **What, if anything, would make someone pay for an advanced version of this?**
    *   *Hypothesis (Highly speculative, for far future):* Enterprise compliance, deep VCS integration for context, advanced analytics. Not a concern for v0.1.0.
5.  **Is this a vitamin (nice-to-have) or a painkiller (solves a real, acute problem)?**
    *   *Hypothesis:* Currently a vitamin. The goal of v0.1.0 and subsequent user feedback is to determine if it can become a painkiller for specific workflows or teams.

*   Clear data on feature usage and user preferences exists.

---

### **Phase 3: Strategic Decision (Post-Phase 2)**
**Goal:** Decide the project's future based on validated usage of comprehensive feature set.
**Key Outcomes:**
    *   Data-driven decision on project direction: maintain, expand, pivot, or sunset.

| Decision Point                                       | Criteria                                                                                                     | Potential Action                                                                                                |
| :--------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Low Adoption** (<10 active users, minimal feedback on comprehensive features) | Comprehensive feature set is not solving significant problems for others. | â€¢ **Sunset:** Archive the project. <br> â€¢ **Personal Tool:** Maintain for personal use only. |
| **Selective Adoption** (Users primarily use only some features, clear preferences emerge) | Some features are highly valued, others ignored. Tool serves specific needs well. | â€¢ **Focused Maintenance:** Emphasize popular features, consider deprecating unused ones. <br> â€¢ **Targeted Documentation:** Focus on validated use cases. |
| **Broad Adoption** (>50 users, active use of multiple features, community engagement) | Comprehensive feature set is solving real problems across different workflows. | â€¢ **Community Building:** Foster contributions and feature requests. <br> â€¢ **Cautious Expansion:** Consider advanced features for proven high-value use cases. |

---

## 3 â–¸ Realistic Success Metrics (Updated for Enhanced Functionality)

*   **Test Coverage:** Achieved and maintained >90%.
*   **Feature Adoption:** Clear data on which features (run, delete, ignore patterns) are most valuable to users.
*   **Installations & Use:** At least 10 distinct projects/users have installed and actively used `v0.1.0` within 1-2 months.
*   **GitHub Stars:** 25-50 stars (as indicator of interest in comprehensive functionality).
*   **Quality Feedback:** At least 3 developers provide feedback specifically on delete functionality, ignore patterns, or CLI UX.
*   **Documentation Effectiveness:** Users successfully adopt multiple features based on documentation.
*   **Real-world Validation:** Evidence that both add and delete workflows are valuable in practice.

---

## 4 â–¸ Resources

*   **Lead Developer (You):** Focused effort on Phase 1 completion. Subsequent investment based on Phase 3 decision.
*   **Contributors:** 1-2 external individuals interested in comprehensive toolset for feedback and contributions.
*   **Budget:** $0 (all tools and platforms are free tier).
*   **Timeline:** Aim to ship feature-complete `v0.1.0` within 2-3 weeks focused effort on remaining priorities.

---

## 5 â–¸ When to Kill This Project

*   If comprehensive `v0.1.0` fails to attract <5 users providing feedback within 2-3 months of promotion.
*   If user feedback indicates the comprehensive feature set is overwhelming or unnecessary for the core problem.
*   If >90% test coverage proves unachievable or maintenance burden exceeds value.
*   If no external interest in the full feature set emerges within 3-4 months post-release.
*   If personal motivation wanes due to lack of validation of the comprehensive approach.

---

## 6 â–¸ Governance & Quality Gates

| Aspect | Policy |
|--------|--------|
| **Semantic Versioning** | MAJOR â‡’ breaking, MINOR â‡’ new features, PATCH â‡’ bug-fix. |
| **Branch Model** | `develop` default, `main` protected for releases, `feature/*`, `fix/*`. |
| **CI Gates** | Ruff, mypy (strict), pytest + >90% coverage target, Bandit. |
| **Review Rules** | Self-review for solo dev, external review preferred if contributors emerge. |
